# Discord-Bot-Tutorial
How to make a discord bot in NodeJS.

## Prerequisites
1. Free Code Camp (finish object orientated javscript)
2. A basic understanding of NodeJS
3. [NPM Explanation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) (Read through, and watch the video)
4. A discord account.

## Creating the Project
1. Start by creating a project folder.
2. Open the folder in atom.
3. Open a terminal and cd (change directory) into the current folder. E.g: `cd PATH/TO/FOLDER`
4. Once you have cd'd into the correct folder type `npm init`, and hit enter.
5. Go through the setup. You can enter custom builds or just tap enter to use the defaults.
7. After the setup has finished, type `npm install --save discord.js` in the command line and wait for it to install.
8. Create an index.js file from atom, or whatever IDE/Text Editor you like to use. You can do this by right clicking the folder tree view (on the right of atom) and selecting create file.
